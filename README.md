# Angular-Route-Injector
======================

ARI is a light weight Angular add-on framework that is used in conjuction with ui-router

ui-router Link : https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router

It is a helper framework that is designed to inject the controller scripts on-demand thus reducing the 
memory foot pripts caused due the prefetched Angular controller modules.

This is a AMD approach to inject controller on demand
